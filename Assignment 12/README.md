Assignment 12 – ICMP Flooding Attack Using RAW Sockets (Mininet Lab)
Objective

To study and understand ICMP-based flooding attacks by generating ICMP packets using RAW sockets in a controlled Mininet environment.

Exercise Description

This assignment demonstrates how ICMP packets can be crafted manually using RAW sockets and sent at a high rate to a target host, simulating an ICMP flood (Ping Flood) attack similar to Assignment 11 (TCP SYN Flood), but using ICMP instead of TCP.

The experiment is conducted only in a virtual lab (Mininet) with multiple hosts acting as attacker and spoofed agents.

Network Topology

A total of six Mininet hosts are used:

Host	Role
h1	Attacker (runs RAW socket ICMP generator)
h2	Victim
h3–h6	Spoofed agent devices
s1	OpenFlow switch

All hosts are connected through a single switch.

Tools & Environment

Linux OS (Ubuntu)

Mininet

GCC Compiler

RAW Socket Programming (C)

Wireshark (for packet capture)

Root privileges (required for RAW sockets)

Concept Overview

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is normally used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., ping).

Using RAW sockets, protocol headers are manually constructed instead of being generated by the OS.

In an ICMP flood scenario:

Large numbers of ICMP Echo Request packets are sent to the victim.

Source IP addresses may be spoofed to simulate distributed agents.

The victim experiences increased CPU and network load.

Implementation Summary

RAW socket is created using the ICMP protocol.

Custom ICMP Echo Request packets are manually constructed.

Source IP addresses are modified to imitate multiple agent hosts.

Packets are sent continuously toward the victim host.

Victim traffic is captured using Wireshark to observe flooding behavior.

Execution Flow (Lab Simulation)

Create Mininet topology with 6 hosts.

Compile the ICMP RAW socket program on the attacker host.

Start packet capture on the victim host using Wireshark.

Execute the ICMP flooding program from the attacker.

Observe high-frequency ICMP packets at the victim.

⚠️ Note: This experiment is performed strictly inside a virtual lab for educational purposes only.

Packet Analysis (Wireshark)

Captured packets show:

ICMP Echo Request messages

High packet rate toward victim

Multiple spoofed source IP addresses

Repeated ICMP Type 8 (Echo Request)

This confirms the flooding behavior.

Sample Observation Output
ICMP Echo Request
Source IP: 10.0.0.x
Destination IP: 10.0.0.2
Type: 8 (Echo Request)
Code: 0


Wireshark graphs indicate a sharp increase in ICMP packet rate during the attack phase.

Learning Outcomes

Understanding of RAW socket programming

Manual construction of ICMP headers

Knowledge of ICMP flooding attack patterns

Experience using Wireshark for traffic analysis

Awareness of network-layer DoS vulnerabilities

Ethical Notice

This assignment is intended only for academic learning inside a controlled environment.
Launching ICMP flooding attacks on real networks without authorization is illegal and unethical.

Conclusion

The experiment successfully demonstrates how ICMP packets can be generated using RAW sockets to simulate a flooding attack in a Mininet lab. It highlights the importance of network monitoring and security mechanisms to detect and mitigate such attacks.
